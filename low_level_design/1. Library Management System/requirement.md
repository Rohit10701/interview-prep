# Low-Level Design for Library Management System

## 1. System Overview
- **Description**: A Library Management System (LMS) to manage books, users, and borrowing activities.
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - User management (librarians, members).
  - Book catalog management.
  - Book borrowing/returning.
  - Search and reservations.
  - Notifications and reminders.

## 2. Actors and User Roles
- **User Roles**:
  - **Librarian**: Manages book inventory and user accounts.
  - **Member**: Searches, borrows/returns, and reserves books.
  - **Admin**: System-level operations and analytics.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Register members and librarians, password hashing, session management.
- **Book Catalog Management**: Add, update, delete books, categorization, and tagging.
- **Book Borrowing/Returning**: Check availability, update book status.
- **Search & Filter**: Search by title, author, genre, etc.
- **Reservations**: Reserve unavailable books, notify on availability.
- **Notifications**: Overdue reminders, reservation availability.
- **Fine Calculation**: Overdue fines and grace periods.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle an increasing number of books and users.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Performance**: Quick search and retrieval of books.
- **Security**: Data encryption, secure APIs, role-based access control.

## 5. System Components and Modules
- **User Module**: Registration, authentication, profile management.
- **Book Module**: Book catalog CRUD operations.
- **Borrowing Module**: Tracks borrowed books, manages returns.
- **Search Module**: Provides search functionality with filters.
- **Notification Module**: Sends email/SMS notifications.
- **Admin Module**: System-level controls and analytics.

## 6. Data Model
- **Entities**:
  - `User`: `userId`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `role`.
  - `Book`: `bookId`, `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `genre`, `availability`.
  - `BorrowRecord`: `borrowId`, `userId`, `bookId`, `borrowDate`, `dueDate`, `returnDate`.
  - `Reservation`: `reservationId`, `userId`, `bookId`, `reservationDate`.
- **Relationships**:
  - `User` to `BorrowRecord`: One-to-many.
  - `User` to `Reservation`: One-to-many.
  - `Book` to `BorrowRecord`: One-to-many.
  - `Book` to `Reservation`: One-to-many.

## 7. APIs and Endpoints
- **User API**:
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate user.
- **Book API**:
  - `GET /books`: Retrieve list of books.
  - `POST /books`: Add a new book.
  - `PUT /books/{id}`: Update book details.
  - `DELETE /books/{id}`: Remove a book.
- **Borrowing API**:
  - `POST /borrow`: Borrow a book.
  - `POST /return`: Return a borrowed book.
- **Reservation API**:
  - `POST /reserve`: Reserve a book.
  - `GET /reservations`: List user reservations.
- **Notification API**:
  - `POST /notify`: Send notifications.

## 8. Detailed Workflows
- **Borrow Book Workflow**:
  1. User searches for a book.
  2. Checks availability.
  3. Borrows the book (updates book status and adds a record in `BorrowRecord`).
- **Return Book Workflow**:
  1. User returns the book.
  2. System updates book availability.
  3. System calculates any overdue fine.
- **Reserve Book Workflow**:
  1. User reserves an unavailable book.
  2. System updates the `Reservation` table.
  3. Sends a notification when the book becomes available.

## 9. Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: OAuth or JWT for session management.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control.
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data.

## 10. Scalability and Performance
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing frequently queried fields.
- **Caching**: In-memory data stores like Redis for frequently accessed data.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming requests to multiple servers.
- **CDN**: Serving static assets.

## 11. Monitoring and Logging
- **Error Logging**: Centralized logging for errors and warnings.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Audit Logs**: Track important actions for accountability.
