## Advanced Memory Management (41-50)

41. Implement a memory-efficient cache with size limits and expiration.
```javascript
class MemoryEfficientCache {
    constructor(maxSize = 100, expirationTime = 3600000) {
        this.cache = new Map();
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
        this.expirationTime = expirationTime;
    }

    set(key, value) {
        if (this.cache.size >= this.maxSize) {
            // Remove oldest entry
            const firstKey = this.cache.keys().next().value;
            this.cache.delete(firstKey);
        }

        this.cache.set(key, {
            value,
            timestamp: Date.now()
        });
    }

    get(key) {
        const item = this.cache.get(key);
        if (!item) return null;

        if (Date.now() - item.timestamp > this.expirationTime) {
            this.cache.delete(key);
            return null;
        }

        return item.value;
    }
}
```

42. How would you implement a memory-efficient event emitter?
```javascript
class MemoryEfficientEmitter {
    constructor() {
        this.events = new Map();
    }

    on(event, callback) {
        if (!this.events.has(event)) {
            this.events.set(event, new Set());
        }
        this.events.get(event).add(callback);
        
        // Return cleanup function
        return () => this.events.get(event).delete(callback);
    }

    emit(event, data) {
        const callbacks = this.events.get(event);
        if (callbacks) {
            callbacks.forEach(callback => callback(data));
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always clean up event listeners when components are destroyed
2. Use WeakMap/WeakSet for references that shouldn't prevent garbage collection
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent memory leaks
4. Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
5. Implement proper cleanup in setTimeout/setInterval
6. Be cautious with closures and ensure variables are properly scoped
7. Use appropriate data structures based on use case
8. Implement proper browser cache management
9. Regular profiling and monitoring of memory usage
10. Use lazy loading and code splitting to manage memory efficiently
