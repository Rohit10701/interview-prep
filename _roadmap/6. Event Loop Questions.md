# Event Loop & Asynchronous Programming - 50 Questions

## Basic Concepts and Understanding (1-10)

1. What is the execution order of this code and why?
```javascript
console.log('1');
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));
```

2. How do microtasks differ from macrotasks in the event loop? Provide examples of each.

3. Explain the behavioral difference between setImmediate, process.nextTick, and queueMicrotask.

4. What happens when you chain multiple .then() handlers to a resolved promise? When do they execute?

5. How does requestAnimationFrame timing differ from setTimeout?

6. Explain how async/await affects the event loop compared to raw promises.

7. What's the difference between setTimeout(fn, 0) and queueMicrotask(fn)?

8. How does the event loop handle nested promises vs nested setTimeout calls?

9. Explain how MessageChannel affects task queuing compared to promises.

10. What's the execution sequence when mixing requestIdleCallback with promises?
