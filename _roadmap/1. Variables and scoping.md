# Variables and Scoping - 50 Questions

## Core Concepts (1-10)

1. Explain the differences between var, let, and const in terms of scoping and hoisting.

2. How does the temporal dead zone (TDZ) affect let and const declarations?

3. What is variable shadowing and how does it work across different scopes?

4. How does block scoping differ from function scoping?

5. Explain how global variables interact with window/global object in different environments.

6. What happens when you declare variables without var/let/const?

7. How do different scopes interact in nested functions?

8. What is variable hoisting and how does it affect program execution?

9. How do module-level variables differ from script-level variables?

10. Explain how const works with objects and arrays. Why can properties still be modified?

## Implementation Challenges (11-20)

11. Implement a scope-based private variable system.

12. Create a module with controlled variable access patterns.
